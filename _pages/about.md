I am a student at Columbia University pursuing a B.S. in Applied Physics and Computer Science, with expected graduation in May 2027. My research interests lie in the intersection of quantum computing and computational physics. 

I have previously worked as a research intern at Columbia University's Basov Lab, where I contributed to the design and implementation of bottom illumination for neaSNOM (scattering-type Scanning Near-field Optical Microscopy). I also worked on real-time astronomical simulations at the University of Georgia and contributed to robotics research at Georgia Tech’s CRAB Lab.

Outside of research, I enjoyed teaching and mentoring students with Cantara, a friend of mine from Indonesia. Additionally, I have participated in multiple hackathons, winning awards for projects at MIT, Yale, and Columbia.

When I’m not working on research or projects, I enjoy exercising such as running and pickleball. I also like exploring new restaurants in NYC.
